Goals In Priority:
1. Read constants.py and create the rb_cleaner and wr_and_te_cleaner
2. Make rb and wr/te finalized datasets
3. Game script feature creator for each position seperately
3. Double check datasets to make sure the calculated stats are correct (probably return the datasets by sorting and groupby)
4. Create gradient boosted tree model
5. Think about adding a game script feature for all positions
